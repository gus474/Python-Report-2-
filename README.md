# Python-Report2
In my report, I've created a report utilizing Python via Jupyer's Notebook for my Economic Transporation class. I address the given problem set with the use of various libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, & Statsmodels to analyze and interpret data observations/outcomes. First I cleaned through the given vehicle dataset, and following I regressed and graphed particular models with different variables in place. I then interpreted my models, and how or why they are reflected in their respective empirical values.  Lastly, I created a logistic model to better predict probabilities before diving into the theoretical aspects of such a function.
